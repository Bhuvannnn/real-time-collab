# Unique Feature Ideas for Collaborative Document Platform

This document outlines innovative features that would differentiate this platform from Google Docs and make it more adaptable for startups and teams.

## 🎯 Core Differentiators

### 1. **Section-Based Granular Permissions** ⭐ (Your Idea - High Impact)
**Description**: Instead of document-level permissions, allow permissions at the section/paragraph level.

**Implementation**:
- Users can select text/paragraphs and set permissions (read/write/comment)
- Visual indicators show which sections are editable/read-only for each user
- Useful for contracts, proposals where different stakeholders need different access levels

**Use Cases**:
- Legal documents (lawyers can edit legal section, clients can only view)
- Product specs (PMs edit features, engineers view only)
- Budget documents (finance team edits numbers, others view only)

**Complexity**: Medium-High
